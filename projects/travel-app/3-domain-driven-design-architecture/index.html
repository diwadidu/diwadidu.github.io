<a href="../1-domain-story-telling">what a user needs to accomplish via domain story telling</a> and then
went on to use what we have discovered to <a href="../2-ux-analysis">create some wireframes</a>, which
have already shown us what kind of information we need to collect and how the data will relate
to each other.</p>
<p>In this step, I’m going to figure out from the (incomplete) wireframe set </p>
<ol>
<li>what data we need to capture,</li>
<li>how the data relates to each other and</li>
<li>ways of grouping the artifacts into logical pieces</li>
<li>parts of the domain language I’m going to use throughout the rest of this project</li>
</ol>
<p>Along the way we’re probably going to find some edge cases we need to figure out — we always
do, don’t we? So let’s dive in …</p>
<h2 id="A-first-look"><a href="#A-first-look" class="headerlink" title="A first look"></a>A first look</h2><p>When looking at the <a href="../1-domain-story-telling">overview domain story</a>, we can already see a few
parts of the system that should be fairly self-contained: First, there is the authentication
piece making a brief appearance here, which will govern the functionality such as logins, 
permissions, user credentials, password resets etc.</p>
<p>Closely related to authentication, represented by the “Traveler” actor in the diagram, is the 
user context. This also represents a well defined set of functionality that is self-contained: 
Sign-up, user management and configuration (such as preferences, language etc.).   </p>
<p>Although the user and authentication contexts are closely related, and need to work together
for the login of a user, one can make the argument, that these should be two separate 
bounded contexts: The user context is for managing the users and the data related to them, 
whereas the authentication context’s task is to handle the authentication throughout the system.</p>
<p>And it could be more than humans that need authentication: Other, non-human systems, even our 
own, might need to get authenticated and the mechanism for authentication might differ between
the various actors. </p>
<p>Another factor in the decision could be the relative frequency with which the user information
and authentication information is accessed: Users usually don’t spend a lot of time managing
their accounts, but authentication potentially needs to happen on every request to an API or 
loading of a new screen. Separating these concerns will allow more control when scaling the 
system.</p>
<p>At this point, a little aside on the management of the login: Since we’re going to have to 
check the authentication potentially on every request, it would be advantageous not to have
to access a database on every request. For this functionality, it might be beneficial to use
<em>JSON Web Tokens</em> (JWT), a technology where <em>claims</em> in JSON format can be validated using a
private key on the server and a signature in the JWT. I don’t want to make a decision right
now, but it is a good thought to keep in mind for later.  </p>
<p><img src="./component-diagram.svg" alt="Component overview diagram based on the domain story"></p>
<p>Next up is the “travel report”. This report would make a logical
bounded context, because it deals with a number of closely related aggregates, value objects
and entities which are mostly self-contained in functionality but need to work together. This 
<em>bounded context</em> can present a well-defined interface to the outside world with which 
to integrate. </p>
<p>Other bounded contexts could talk to the <em>travel report</em> context using some of the DDD 
paradigms such as a <em>published language</em> or an <em>anti-corruption layer</em> (ACL) to not mix 
(pollute) the domain languages in the various bounded contexts. </p>
<p>Finally, we have the icon for “Travel Journal app” in the domain story (or “TravelAppContext”
in the UMP diagram shown above). From the domain story drawing we can see that the 
functionality of this context is to provide a somewhat generic overview of existing
trips reports, create new ones, and be a jumping-off point for any other contexts we 
might identify in the future.</p>
<p>In this small project, it is hard to see exactly what this context, if we decided to split 
this off into its own, would include, but it’s at the very least a good indicator that this
might be its own context in the future.  </p>
<h2 id="A-closer-look-at-the-trip-context"><a href="#A-closer-look-at-the-trip-context" class="headerlink" title="A closer look at the trip context"></a>A closer look at the trip context</h2><p>Now that we have the general lay of the land, let’s take a closer look at the trips
bounded context, in particular the data classes involved in this part of the domain and
how they are related to each other. I will leave out for now other architectural concepts such as
controllers, API interfaces, services etc. That will be topic for another post, as we get closer to 
actually implementing this system on the backend. There will also be a frontend architecture 
treatment, since the domains will be the same, but the view classes will be different from what
we need on the server backend.</p>
<p>Travel trips will be the main data we’re going to handle in our application, so we can start 
our discussion there. From the <a href="../2-ux-analysis">wireframes in the previous post</a>
we can see that a trip consists of the following data for now:</p>
<ol>
<li>title</li>
<li>start and end dates</li>
<li>one (or more) activity types such as biking, hiking etc.</li>
<li>a brief summary as</li>
<li>a cover picture, so we can make the trip appealing in a listing situation</li>
</ol>
<p>Right on the home page wireframe, we see that we need to display a list of trips with some 
of that data in addition to a map presenting the locations of those trips. In the UX, it was
decided that for now, we’re going to simply put a marker at the center of the trail, so
we can deduce that we should add a property for the marker coordinates to the <code>Trip</code> class.</p>
<p>The other option would be to store an entire GPS trace with the <code>Trip</code> instance, but that might
cause several headaches later:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our trip consists of multiple days, so the amount of data to store would be large</li>
<li>Each stage of the trip will likely have its own trace, so loading the data from a database
for each trip would be more difficult and likely slower, or we’d have to duplicate the data and
keep it in sync should it change. </li>
<li>From a UX perspective, clicking a thin line is harder than clicking on an icon, in particular 
when several trips overlap, are close to each other or cross each other in the same geographic 
region. Having an icon<ul>
<li>allows us to show more details on hover in addition to</li>
<li>contain an icon indicating the type of trip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For those reasons, the decision with a single icon makes sense and is easier to implement, despite
requiring the addition of a property to the <code>Trip</code> entity.</p>
<p>In terms of <em>domain driven design</em> principles, the <code>Trip</code> is an <em>Aggregate root</em> “containing” 
several <em>Entities</em>, to which we’re going to come next.</p>
<p>We now have a representation for our trip, but not for the details. A trip in this scenario is
made up of days of travel, so we should reflect that with a <code>TravelDayReport</code> class, which
will contain the content for the day and will have its own “page” in the application. This
class will contain</p>
<ol>
<li>the date of travel</li>
<li>a number representing the day of the trip (for convenience)</li>
<li>a summary of the day’s activities the user can supply</li>
<li>a list of keywords so users can find it to get inspiration</li>
<li>the main content for the trip report for that date</li>
</ol>
<p>This is another <em>entity</em> with relationships to two lists for</p>
<ol>
<li>an entity to store the information on the path or path section taken</li>
<li>an entity containing an image <strong>set</strong> for that day’s travel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both are implemented as <code>List</code>s because a travel day might be encompassing several different
modes of transportation, which we might want to later represent differently visually. For 
example, a user might go hiking one way and take a tour boat or canoe back to the starting 
place (been there, done that).</p>
<p>The same holds true for the images, as a user might not want to place all images in a particular
spot on the post, but maybe break images up with the flow of the story. These are reasonable 
assumptions, and implementing these two relationships as one-to-many is prudent and should not
significantly increase development time. </p>
<p>To get certainty in this case, we should ask the 
customer whether that is something that is already considered and whether it is desirable later
on to have trips which are not split after that feature will have been rolled out to customers.</p>
<p>Speaking of images …</p>
<h3 id="Managing-images"><a href="#Managing-images" class="headerlink" title="Managing images"></a>Managing images</h3><p>When thinking of the management of images, a fundamental question is whether a particular image
can only be used in one or in many posts. If it is to be used in many posts, it is reasonable to
assume that the user wants to change the image caption on a per-story basis. If the client agrees
with that assessment, it leads to the following two likely classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A globally usable <code>RepoImage</code> class, which serves to manage the images globally and contains 
information specific to the image, such as a title, keywords, a URL under which the image is
stored on a CDN, a generic description of the image to be used in HTML <code>alt</code> attributes as well
as possibly a set of coordinates for the location the image was taken in.</li>
<li>A trip-specific, smaller <code>TripImage</code> class which stores the URL, geo location and a caption 
specific to the post/story.</li>
</ol>
<p>Skipping the discussion of a few more classes we can identify, we end up with a class diagram 
such as this (ignoring authentication for now):   </p>
<p><img src="./class-diagram.svg" alt="Class diagram"></p>
<h2 id="Introducing-structure"><a href="#Introducing-structure" class="headerlink" title="Introducing structure"></a>Introducing structure</h2><p>That class diagram already contains a lot of detail knowledge, but it is currently just a bunch
of classes which communicate with each other, exchange data etc. To improve on this state, we’re
going to group the various classes using the <em>domain driven design</em> (DDD) approach by sleuthing 
out which functionality belongs together, and which can be separated, communicating with each 
other through interfaces and other approaches used in DDD (see, for example, <a href="https://vaughnvernon.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vaughn Vernon’s 
“Implementing Domain Driven Design”</a> for possible integration patterns
between bounded contexts such as <em>Published Language</em> or <em>Anticorruption Layers</em>, a.k.a. ACLs).</p>
<p>Looking at the class diagram, we see that a lot of the classes (entities and value objects 
in DDD speak) have to do with managing trips. Not listed among the classes are things like 
services and repositories, which take care of the interaction of entities and object persistence,
respectively. One such example is a service which would manage the addition or modification of
a day report to a trip, since here, we’d have to modify two entities: the TripReport and the 
report for the day. If one fails, we can encapsulate the roll-back in a service.</p>
<p>One question from the UML diagram is where the image management belongs. The images belong to the
trips, but should they also be part of the same bounded context? </p>
<p>I’d argue that the image management is its own bounded context, which integrates with the <em>Trips
Context</em> through one of the integration patterns. The reason for this decision is that</p>
<ol>
<li>at this point it is a one-to-many relationship, where the <code>RepoImage</code> instance does not need
to have a reference to the trips it is being used in.</li>
<li>we need to store a dedicated caption per story anyway, so we need a simplified reference to 
the image for our trips </li>
</ol>
<p>In the UML diagram we see the <code>TripImage</code> class, which serves as a simplified proxy of the 
<code>RepoImage</code> in the context of travel. The use of an <em>anticorruption layer</em> (ACL) on the side
of the <code>RepoImage</code> context would allow us to separate not only the functionality but also the 
nomenclature used in the two domains: While an image might be referred to as <em>TripImage</em> in the
trips context to distinguish it from other images, e.g. advertising images, or portraits of 
account holders (<code>UserImage</code> or <code>ProfileImage</code>), in the <code>ImagesContext</code> it might simply be <code>Image</code> or even 
<code>Photo</code>.</p>
<p>This one-way relationship has the effect that we can delete the image reference for the trip 
and still have the image available for other pages/stories in the ImageContext. Conversely, 
removing an image from the <code>ImageContext</code> would invalidate the URL of the <code>TripImage</code> in the 
TripContext. This means we now have the option to knowingly ignore that fact and try to display 
missing images or put some smarts into the <code>TripsContext</code> to load images and filter out ones 
that return a 404 or 410 HTTP code.</p>
<p>Another argument for separating the images from the trips into their own context is that we can
now easily add new image-based features, such as photo albums which can be put together and sent
to a printer from the application, without having to go through trips. This is shown in the 
UML diagrm below, which introduces a new (and incomplete) <code>PhotoAlbumContext</code> for illustration.</p>
<p><img src="./domain-diagram.svg" alt="Diagram grouping building blocks into domains"></p>
<h2 id="Adding-functionality-considering-storage"><a href="#Adding-functionality-considering-storage" class="headerlink" title="Adding functionality, considering storage"></a>Adding functionality, considering storage</h2><p>We now have a nice idea of what data types and classes we need, but not quite yet 
how we should structure our code into <em>Aggregates</em>, <em>Entities</em> and <em>Value Objects</em>.</p>
<p>It would be natural to model our <code>Trip</code> entity as an aggregate root, which contains all the 
other entities and value objects. The consequence of that would be a humongous object that 
would take a long time to create from the database, with only a small subset of the data needed
for each use of the aggregate — This is not even mentioning the required bandwidth to 
ship such a massive object over the wire to the requesting computer.</p>
<p>To reduce the load on the application, it would be good to reduce the amount of unnecessary 
database requests and data to be loaded for each request, yet still encapsulate the data in 
an aggregate and not expose the functionality of contained entities to the outside.</p>
<h3 id="A-way-to-store-data"><a href="#A-way-to-store-data" class="headerlink" title="A way to store data"></a>A way to store data</h3><p>One possible way out of the data glut would be to break with the paradigm to store data 
normalized in the database. The following data sets might be candidates for duplication, 
judging by the screen mockups the UX designer has put down the pipe for us:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>Trip</code> doesn’t need all the data from each travel day, just a summary, the sequence number
(as the <code>Trip</code>  has the travel dates stored) and possibly the travel mode.</li>
<li>Since we decided to represent a trip on the overview map as a pin of some sort, we don’t
need to access the GPS trace entry at all for the overview.</li>
<li>Adding an image to an image set should be side-effect free as we’re simply creating a new
instance of a <code>TripImage</code>, which can be modeled as a <em>Value Object</em>, i.e. a class without 
an id. </li>
</ol>
<p>This deduplication bears the risk of data getting out of sync. This is where a <em>service</em> will 
help. Services are stateless objects that encapsulate some aspect of the business logic. To 
defuse this data-out-of-sync problem, we could create a service whose task it is to update
a trip day and synchronize it with the data on the trip instance. </p>
<p>The service would be called to perform the data mutation in a single place, use an injected 
<em>repository</em> to store the mutated objects. Having the mutation in a single class would also
enable us to create compensation mechanisms in case only one of the mutations executes 
successfully. Since we would return the user to an overview page of some sort in this application, 
the service does not need to return the mutated objects, because the new landing page will 
request the needed data from the server.  </p>
<p>One other paradigm that supports us in this task is <em>immutability</em> of the data objects in 
question: When the second of the two persistence calls to a repo fails repeatedly, we still have
the original instance accessible and can easily roll back the first change. This immutability 
was demonstrated for the <a href="/functional-programming/implementing-the-option-monad-in-javascript/">Option monad implemented in JavaScript</a>
on this site.</p>
<p>As a final point regarding storage is the form of storage: Document-based or table-based? For 
this app’s use case, I would argue for a document-based storage, because the document-based 
approach would assist us in creating nested, denormalized data sets and make the data structure 
clearer:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the aforementioned case of the <code>trip</code>, it would be trivial to create a nested 
data structure which would contain the data for the <code>Trip</code> as well as an array for the 
summary of each day of the trip.</li>
<li>The same argument holds for the <code>TravelDayImageSet</code> housed in the <code>TravelDayReport</code>. Here,
one can consider storing the set information together with the <code>TripImage</code> information 
in a sub-document of the <code>TravelDayReport</code> to avoid multi-join on the DB. The data for each
entry is manageable, so it would not make the record explode in size, since we’re storing the
images on a CDN and only store their URLs in the DB this would cut out a significant amount
of work for the DB to collect all the records for the image from a traditional relational
database. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>This was a whirlwind tour through setting up a server-side architecture for a large part of 
the application to be built. We’ve looked at the following topics together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which data types are needed for the application to store all the information as well as</li>
<li>What is the relationship between them,</li>
<li>How does the UX analysis inform some optimizations we can consider,</li>
<li>The way domain driven design can inform the structuring of the code in our application and</li>
<li>Which flavor of database would be a good fit for this project.  </li>
</ol>
<p>We ended up with a few bounded contexts, namely the <strong>TripsContext</strong>, <strong>ImagesContext</strong>, a
future <strong>PhotoAlbumContext</strong> and skipped talking about two other contexts, the 
<strong>UserManagementContext</strong> and <strong>AuthorizationContext</strong>. These are left for another time… </p>
